What is the Landing Festival?

### About Landing.jobs

Weâ€™re a team on a mission to make tech recruitment a rewarding experience for everyone. As a candidate-driven marketplace, we empower tech professionals with the tools they need to make better decisions for their careers.

Our Landing Festival events are the moments when we break out of the digital world and meet our community face-to-face, while still helping them through the activities planned.
