What is the Landing Festival?

Landing Festival is brought to you by the Landing.jobs team.

We’re a team on a mission to make tech recruitment a rewarding experience for everyone. As a candidate-driven marketplace, we empower tech professionals with the tools they need to make better decisions for their careers.

Our Landing Festival events are the moments when we break out of the digital world and meet our community face-to-face, while still helping them through the activities planned.

### Previous Editions

We kicked it off three years ago in sunny Lisbon and it has been a blast ever since. Each edition has surpassed its predecessor so you know you’re signing up for a wild ride.

To sum it up, in these three years we’ve managed to fly the first sardine into space, organize the first drone race in Lisbon and introduce 3000+ tech professionals to more than 200+ tech companies.
