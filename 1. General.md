What is the Landing Festival?

### About Landing.jobs

We’re a team on a mission to make tech recruitment a rewarding experience for everyone. As a candidate-driven marketplace, we empower tech professionals with the tools they need to make better decisions for their careers.

Our Landing Festival events are the moments when we break out of the digital world and meet our community face-to-face, while still helping them through the activities planned.

### Previous Editions

We kicked it off three years ago in sunny Lisbon and it has been a blast ever since. Each edition has surpassed its predecessor so you know you’re signing up for a wild ride.

To sum it up, in these three years we’ve managed to fly the first sardine into space, organize a drone race on the Lisbon Marina and introduce 2500+ tech professionals to more than 100+ tech companies.
