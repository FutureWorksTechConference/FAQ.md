# Slack Community

Before, during and after the event you can keep youself up to date with everything Festival on the Landing Festival Slack community.

### But wait - why should I join?

Besides informing youself about the activities happening, this will also be the perfect place to get in touch with other attendees, companies, speakers and the Landing staff.

Event spaces and topics will be grouped in channels; this way you'll be able to **find the content that most interests you!**

### How can I join?

A few weeks before the Festival you will receive an invite email on the account associated with your Landing Festival registration. The link on that email will enable you to enter our community.

If for some reason you don't get the invite link or you have any issue with it, [use this invite link](https://landingfestival.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMzA3NzU5NTMzMzQ1LTg1YmE1OTFjZTNmOGZjYWQwMDY5YjVhMzViN2NlY2I0MzdjMDIyYjZjOTc1YzI0MGYxMmQ5MzQ3MjY4YTZkN2U) to directly insert yourself in the community.
