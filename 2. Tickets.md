### Registration Process

> Can anyone register for the Landing Festival and get accepted?

The Landing Festival is tailored for tech professionals such as Developers, Digital Designers, Product Managers, Data Scientists, DevOps, etc.

Once you get your ticket, our team will confirm your attendance to the Landing Festival.

> I'm trying to get into tech or a computer science student, can I go & get unplugged?

Of course you can, actually we have student promo codes - reach out to us and ask for one: contact@landingfestival.com.

> How does the ticket purchase process works?

To start, click on "Tickets" on [our website](https://landingfestival.com/berlin/tickets?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=ticket&utm_campaign=festival).

We will require you to select your preferred type of ticket and give us some information about yourself: first & last name, e-mail and password and the city you're based in.

The site will then require you to fill in payment information for the ticket you previously selected.

Once payment data validation is successful, you'll be taken to a success screen, and you're done! Our payment provider is Stripe to make sure your transaction is safe. All your data is encrypted and we won't have direct access to it.

> When will you charge my credit card?

Only after our team has confirmed your attendance, we'll proceed with the payment processing via Stripe.

If we have problems processing the payment, our Support team will reach out to make sure you're in.
