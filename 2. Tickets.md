### Registration Process

> Can anyone register for the Landing Festival and get in?

The Landing Festival is tailored for tech professionals such as Developers, Digital Designers, Product Managers, Data Scientists, DevOps, etc.

There's two ways go get in:
- Buy a ticket (Access or Premium)

Of course you can, actually... We've got Student promo codes - reach out to us and ask for one: contact@landingfestival.com.
