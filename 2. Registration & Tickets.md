The site will then require you to fill in payment information for the pass you previously selected, namely:

Once payment data validation is successful, you'll be taken to a success screen, and you're done!

Only after our team has confirmed your attendance, we'll proceed with the processing of the payment, using the data previously collected. Please note the payments are processed via Stripe.com. All your data is encrypted and we won't have direct access to it.
