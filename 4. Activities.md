> Can I speak at the Landing Festival?

Not anymore, we did run a Call for Speakers contest though so keep an eye for new initiatives.

### Talks

*More than just talking we’ll give you a mental kick to engage and discuss with other tech heads.*

We bring the brightest minds of tech to share with you stories of success and failure, launches and bugs, dreams and bluffs. The future of tech and careers brought to you in a two-day mental bootcamp.

### Workshops

*Test our funky playground, learn how to Kung Fu and kick ass in no time.*

Want to get your hands dirty? Escape the net, unplug from the Matrix and learn from the bold and brave of the tech industry.

### Expert Sessions

*Meet and greet tech experts that will show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.*

Networking can be a tough discipline, but not if we bring you close to the people you want to meet and connect with. Challenge yourself and engage with experienced professionals. Don’t be just another brick in the wall, take part in meaningful one-on-one discussions.

### Job Fair

*Dodge recruitment specialists like bullets and face real tech professionals.

Mingle with the tech talent of top 50 selected companies in out meet and greet area. Discuss future opportunities with fellow techies and avoid the recruitment agents. With us you can land your dream job in a day!*

### Boat Party

What better way to wrap-up two days of craziness than a boat party? Get on board to see the wild side of Landing Festival on the Spree river. Also, Tim Fitzhigham, the British comedian who crossed the English channel on a bathtub, will be making a special appearance on our Landing Festival Berlin boat party :)

**Only available for Premium ticket holders.**

### Fun, fun, fun

Tetley Clarke will be doing a live art performance, we don't want to spoil it so we won't say no more. Let's just say he's Landing.jobs' loyal cartoonist.

There's also going to be some Christoph Wilke's magic mixed with iPad, say no more!
