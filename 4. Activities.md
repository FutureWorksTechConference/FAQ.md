### Talks

*More than just talking we’ll give you a mental kick to engage and discuss with other tech heads.*

We bring the brightest minds of tech to share with you stories of success and failure, launches and bugs, dreams and bluffs. The future of careers in tech brought to you in a two-day mental bootcamp.

### Expo Area

*Dodge recruitment specialists like bullets and face real tech professionals.*

Mingle with the tech talent of top 60 selected companies in out meet and greet area. Discuss future opportunities with fellow techies and avoid the recruitment agents. With us you can land your dream job in a day!

### Workshops

**Only available for Premium ticket holders.**

*Test our funky playground, learn how to Kung Fu and kick ass in no time.*

Want to get your hands dirty? Escape the net, unplug from the Matrix and learn from the bold and brave of the tech industry.

We're just letting Premium ticket holders register for one workshop so everyone has the chance to select their favorite. However, at the check-in, we'll give you the chance to enrol for other workshops if there's any spots left.

### Expert Roundtables

**Only available for Premium ticket holders.**

*Meet and greet tech experts that will show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.*

Networking can be a tough discipline, but not if we bring you close to the people you want to meet and connect with. Challenge yourself and engage with experienced professionals. Don’t be just another brick in the wall, take part in meaningful one-on-one discussions.

### Boat Trip / Boat Party

**Only available for Access and Premium ticket holders.**

What better way to wrap-up all the Landing Festival craziness than a boat trip? Get on board to see the wild side of Landing Festival on the Tagus river.
